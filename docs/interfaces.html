    <h2>Interface</h2>

    <p>
        Interface functions are abstract. They take wallet contents and options
        as input, and they produce wallet contents and side effects as output.
    </p>

    <p>
        In order to ensure portability, wallet interfaces MUST be functions of
        JSON, and MUST NOT take complex instances of classes, functions or other
        types of object.
    </p>

    <p>
        A wallet implementation MAY implement a subset of the interfaces defined below.

        For example:
    <ul>
        <li>A verifiable credential wallet might not implement the
        <code>Transfer</code> interface.</li>
        <li>The <code>Query</code> interface of a verifiable credential wallet
        might be specific to credential search.</li>
        <li>A wallet implementation which relies on an external storage,
        such as encrypted data vaults, might choose not to implement
        <code>Export</code>, <code>Import</code>, <code>Lock</code>, and/or
        <code>Unlock</code> interfaces.</li>
    </ul>

    </p>

    <section>
        <h3>Import</h3>
        <p>
        Takes a serialized exported wallet representation as input. Loads the
        representation into wallet software.
        </p>
        <p>
        This method may not be necessary for implementations that rely on
        external storage, such as Encrypted Data Vaults.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Export</h3>

        <p>Only ciphertext wallet contents can be exported.</p>

        <p>Produces a serialized exported wallet representation.</p>

        <p>
            This method may not be necessary for implementations that rely on
            external storage, such as Encrypted Data Vaults.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Add</h3>
        <p>
        Takes a serialized export of wallet content, loads the
        representation into wallet software.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Remove</h3>
        <p>
        Takes an IRI to wallet content or the content by value, 
        if present, removes the representation into wallet software.
        </p>
    </section>


    <section>
        <h3>Unlock</h3>
        <p>
        Transforms one or more wallet contents from ciphertext to plaintext.
        </p>

        <p>Requires knowledge of the password used to lock the wallet.</p>

        <p>
        This method may not be necessary for implementations that rely on
        external storage, such as Encrypted Data Vaults.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Lock</h3>
        <p>
        Transforms one or more wallet contents from plaintext to ciphertext.
        </p>
        <p>Requires knowledge of the password used to lock the wallet.</p>

        <p>
        This method may not be necessary for implementations that rely on
        external storage, such as Encrypted Data Vaults.
        </p>

        <div class="issue" data-number="5">
        Mostly a reference implementation issue. Locked representation should
        indicate a best practice.
        </div>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>SignRaw</h3>
        <p>
        Takes a Buffer as input, and an <code>options</code> object, which
        contains at least a <code>verificationMethod</code>, and may contain
        additonal details such as <code>alg</code> or other JOSE related
        terms.
        </p>

        <p>Must support detached signatures.</p>

        <p>
            This method may not be necessary for implementations that rely on
            other dedicated interface functions to perform signing.

            For example, a verifiable credential wallet that adds proofs
            using <code>Issue</code> or <code>Prove</code> interfaces might
            not implement this interface.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>VerifyRaw</h3>
        <p>
        Takes a Buffer as input, and an <code>options</code> object, which
        contains at least a <code>verificationMethod</code>, and may contain
        additonal details such as <code>alg</code> or other JOSE related
        terms.
        </p>

        <p>Must support detached signatures.</p>

        <p>
            This method may not be necessary for implementations that rely on
            other dedicated interface functions to verify signatures.

            For example, a verifiable credential wallet that can verify
            credential proofs using <code>Verify</code> interface might
            not implement this interface.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Verify</h3>

        <p>
        Takes a Verifiable Credential or Verifiable Presentation as input;
        returns a boolean <code>verified</code>, and an error object
        <code>error</code> if <code>verified</code> if false.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h3>Issue</h3>

        <p>
        Takes a Verifiable Credential without a <code>proof</code>, and an
        <code>options</code> object.
        </p>

        <p>Produces a Verifiable Credential.</p>

        <p>
            Here are the options that can be used to produce a verifiable credential:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/#dfn-verification-method">verificationMethod</a> </li>
            <li><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/#dfn-created">created </a> </li>
            <li><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/#dfn-controller">controller </a> </li>
            <li><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/#dfn-domain">domain </a> </li>
            <li><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/#dfn-challenge">challenge </a> </li>
            <li><a href="https://w3c-ccg.github.io/ld-proofs/#dfn-proof-type">proofType </a> </li>
        </ul>

        Beware that while the challenge comes from the verifier and must be signed over.


        The domain is a "suggestion", and it is the holder who chooses to follow this suggestion or not.

        The term "domain" is meant to behave as the term "aud" for those familiar with JOSE.
